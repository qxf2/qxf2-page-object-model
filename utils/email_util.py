"""
A simple IMAP util that will help us with account activation
* Connect to your imap host
* Login with username/password
* Fetch latest messages in inbox
* Get a recent registration message
* Filter based on sender and subject
* Return text of recent messages

[TO DO](not in any particular order)
1. Extend to POP3 servers
2. Add a try catch decorator
3. Enhance get_latest_email_uid to make all parameters optional
